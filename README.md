# Overview

## Description

As a passionate dinosaur enthusiast, here, you can engage in discussions about recent discoveries, share your own findings, and dive into debates about various theories surrounding dinosaurs. Whether you're seeking advice on starting your own fossil collection, want to discuss the latest research papers, or simply crave a space to indulge in your love for these prehistoric beasts, a dinosaur forum would serve as your virtual museum, fostering a sense of community among those who share your passion.

## User Story

  So…
  -That I can learn, share, and build a sense of community with other dino-lovers!
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Render (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Installation

- Clone repository.
  <br>
- Install Nodejs.
  <br>
- Install a source-code editor like VsCode.

## Usage Instruction

Step 1: In order to run the application locally, MongoDb must be installed.
<br>
Step 2: Open VsCode(preferred) or another source-code editor if not already running.
<br>
Step 3: Open integrated terminal once in the main folder.
<br>
Step 4: From the root-package.json, enter "run npm i" in the terminal to install the required dependencies.
<br>
Step 7: After the "API server running on port 3001!" appears in the console, the application will open in a new browser window. If not, open your browser and type the localhost & port (in the console) in your browser address bar.

## Test Instructions:

For testing and debugging, the application logs requests and errors in the console. MongoDb, a server software application and a database administration tool, is also recommended to view the database and see it "visually."
